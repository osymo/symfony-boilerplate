On the webapp folder in file ConfirmDelete.vue 
we have a template with the delete button in it,
once the button is clicked the variable "showConfirmDeleteForm" is set to true
then a confirmation message appears next to an input, a "cancel button" and a second "delete button".
When the user type "confirm" in that input and click on the second delete button
the "onSubmit" method in the same file is called, 
then the "onConfirm" method is called
then the "onDelete" methode from the file "_id.vue" is called
then the "DeleteUserMutation" method is called with the userId
then the methode "deleteUser" in the file "DeleteUser.php" is called.

This method checks if the logged user has the auhtoriation to delete the target user,
then it deletes the profile picture of the user
then it deletes the user from the database using the delete methode of the "BaseUserDao.php" 
this method calls the the "deleteCascade" method of the "TDBMService" class
